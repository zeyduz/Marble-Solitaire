Marble Solitaire is a Java implementation of the classic Peg (Marble) Solitaire board game, structured using the Model‑View‑Controller design pattern. It supports multiple board configurations—such as the English, European, and triangular layouts—and offers both a GUI-based interactive experience and a flexible command-line mode. Built for a CS Object‑Oriented Design project, the game enforces marble-jump rules, game-over detection, and score tracking, making it ideal for exploring design principles like abstraction, enums, factories, and MVC architecture.
